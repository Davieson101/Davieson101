## 🚀 About Me

💡 I’m currently a learner in the <strong>ALX Software Engineering Program</strong>, specializing in <strong>Front-End Development</strong>.  
🔧 I started this journey because I was inspired by the power of coding – the ability to give commands to a machine and turn ideas into interactive experiences.

🎯 My mission is to:
- Master coding skills and launch a successful tech career
- Build innovative and meaningful projects
- Share knowledge and uplift others through tech

🌍 I love discussing technology and exploring new fields like:
- Web Development & Web Applications
- Responsive UI/UX Design
- Machine Learning (aspirationally!)
